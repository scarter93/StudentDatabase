# StudentDatabase
Student records and student records database written in C++.

## StudentRecord Class

Holds information on a student, name, ID, and classes
Would be interesting to add a grades option to with GPA/Average.

##StudentRecordDatabase Class

This is my take on a database for the StudentRecords class.
Currently uses a unordered_map (HashMap) to map student ID's to their records.
This might need some cleaning up, I'm not sure if I want to keep this hash or if theres a better mapping.

##TODO

Finsih up StudentRecordDatabase Class and add more detail to StudentRecord Class.
Add comments, expections and deconstructors.

##Usage

Coming soon
